App für Android, IOS, und den Web Browser.Mit der App wird das Aufteilen von Rechnungen/Einnahmen in Gruppen vereinfacht.Man fügt Freunde hinzu mit denen man neue Gruppen erstellen kann, wie z.B. für ein Festival oder eine WG.In der Gruppe kann man neue Transaktionen erstellen, die allen Teilnehmern der Transaktion angezeigt werden.Dadurch entsteht eine strukturierte Überischt über wem man noch
